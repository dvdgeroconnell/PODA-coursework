## How To Use  
Jupyter notebooks may in general be opened in any appropriate editor. They both include Markdown test and Python code.  
Any package dependencies are captured as import commands.  
Visual Studio Code version 1.88.0 was used to develop this notebook.  
The Python 3.11.7 kernel was used to run the code.  
For the versions of the other packages used, please see the **Packages Used** section of the *penguins.ipynb* notebook.

**Note** - this was added for completeness, however Google Colab appears to support only basic Markdown syntax, not the extended Markdown with elements such as tables that GitHub Markdown supports. Viewing the *penguins* notebook in [GitHub](https://github.com/dvdgeroconnell/PODA-coursework.git) is recommended.
