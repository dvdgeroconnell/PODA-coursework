# PODA-coursework
## Coursework for the Principles of Data Analytics module  
This repository contains:  
- penguins.ipynb, a Jupyter notebook which retrieves and analyses the Palmer Penguins csv file.  
- iris.ipynb, a Jupyter notebook which retrieves and analyses the iris data set.  
The Python pandas and numpy packages are used to analyze and visualize the data.  
The iris notebook was created following along with the week 08 video series.  

## Test Code  
Created test-code folder 3rd March 2024 to hold any files associated with test and lab work, but not  
required for the Palmer penguins notebook.
