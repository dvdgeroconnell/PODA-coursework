# Purpose of this Repository  
<a name="Purpose-of-this-Repository"></a>
This repository contains the files associated with the Principles of Data Analytics coursework. More specifically, it contains Jupyter notebook and associated files on the palmerpenguins data set. Other materials are stored in a separate repository, to keep this one focused on the material required for the assessment.

This repository contains:  
#### penguins.ipynb
A Jupyter notebook which retrieves and analyses the Palmer Penguins csv file.  


## How To Use  
Jupyter notebooks may be opened in any appropriate editor. They both include Markdown test and  
Python code.  
Any code in the Test Code folder should be standalone Python files that can be run independently.
Any package dependencies are captured as import commands.  

I used [openincolab.com](https://openincolab.com) to generate the following clickable link. It opens the notebook in Google Colab.
