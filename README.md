**Note** - this was added for completeness, however Google Colab appears to support only basic Markdown syntax, not the extended Markdown with elements such as tables that GitHub Markdown supports. Viewing the *penguins* notebook in [GitHub](https://github.com/dvdgeroconnell/PODA-coursework.git) is recommended.
