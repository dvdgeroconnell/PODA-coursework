# Purpose of this Repository  
<a name="Purpose-of-this-Repository"></a>
This repository contains the files associated with the Principles of Data Analytics coursework. More specifically, it contains Jupyter notebook and associated files on the palmerpenguins data set. Other materials are stored in a separate repository, to keep this one focused on the material required for the assessment.

## About this README

## About This Project  
This repository contains:  
#### penguins.ipynb
A Jupyter notebook which retrieves and analyses the Palmer Penguins csv file.  
#### iris.ipynb
A Jupyter notebook which retrieves and analyses the iris data set.  
The Python pandas and numpy packages are used to analyze and visualize the data.  
The iris notebook was created following along with the week 08 video series.  
#### information.ipynb
A Jupyter notebook created as a follow-along with PoDA lecture t10v04_bytes.
#### test-code
A folder for test-code created 3rd March 2024 to hold any files associated with test  
and lab work, but not required for the Palmer penguins or iris notebooks.  

## How To Use  
Jupyter notebooks may be opened in any appropriate editor. They both include Markdown test and  
Python code.  
Any code in the Test Code folder should be standalone Python files that can be run independently.
Any package dependencies are captured as import commands.
