## About This Project  
This repository contains:  
- penguins.ipynb, a Jupyter notebook which retrieves and analyses the Palmer Penguins csv file.  
- iris.ipynb, a Jupyter notebook which retrieves and analyses the iris data set.  
  The Python pandas and numpy packages are used to analyze and visualize the data.  
  The iris notebook was created following along with the week 08 video series.  
- test-code, a folder for test-code created 3rd March 2024 to hold any files associated with test  
  and lab work, but not required for the Palmer penguins or iris notebooks.  

## How To Use  
Jupyter notebooks may be opened in any appropriate editor. They both include Markdown test and  
Python code.  
Any code in the Test Code folder should be standalone Python files that can be run independently.
Any package dependencies are captured as import commands.
